## Step one

- A teacher has finished grading their students' tests and needs your help to calculate the average score for the class.

- Complete the getAverage function which takes in an array of test scores and returns the average score.

- The average is calculated by adding up all the scores and dividing by the total number of scores.

- Example Code
    - average = sum of all scores / total number of scores

- A couple of function calls have been provided for you so you can test out your code.

### Tips

- You can use a loop to iterate over the scores array and add up all the scores.

- You can use the length property to get the total number of scores.
